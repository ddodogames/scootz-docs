`scootz.js` is a silly package for aoi.js that registers custom functions you can use.

In this documentation, you will mostly find functions available of the package you can use in your aoi.js bot. Nothing fancy about it i would say.

:::note
`scootz.js` is not made by official aoi.js developers and so therefore, do not request support for the package in their official support server. Instead, request support for it by going into [Github Issues](https://github.com/ddodogames/scootz.js/issues/new/choose).
