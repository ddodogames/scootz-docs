the source code on how this was setup belongs to `Kawaii#7615`, thank him/her later for the aoi.js plugins tutorial later.
* `Kawaii#7615` (i don't remember their username): for the aoi.js plugins tutorial later
* [`Blur`](https://github.com/Bumblebee-3): for helping me on getting this package to work
* [`InikoMatthewPro`](https://github.com/InikoMatthewPro): for publishing the package on npm

Most of these are for the original (now discontinued) package of `dodoplugins.js` but the first one still applies so.
