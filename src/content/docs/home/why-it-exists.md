title: Why it exists?
---

It originally started as `dodoplugins.js` which was only made because i got annoyed of having to update multiple custom functions in each bot project i have. This was how the original package was born. 

At the time it was made, aoi.js had problems with custom functions in aoi.js type which hindered the development as i did not fully know javascript. I eventually had no choice but to discontinue it since it's been 2 years and nothing was addressed about it.

In the end, it was finally addressed in 2024! So, as part of this, i decided to refresh the package as `scootz.js` with both new and updated stuff (including easier management of versions published of the package as well).
